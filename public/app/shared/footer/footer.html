        Ride on share is a car pooling service which has a vision to change the way we finish our daily commute. You can just see which vehicle is using your route and get into them.      </p>

        We launched with Books and Movies &amp; TV Shows and have expanded our offerings to include the Kindle family of E-Readers, the Amazon Fashion Store and various products under different categories. Customers can now buy products from popular brands across categories such as Samsung mobiles, Dell laptops, Canon cameras, Fastrack watches and many more at Amazon.in. Don’t forget to shop for Today's Deals on Amazon and save big every day. On Amazon shopping is not only about buying, it's also about gifting and through Gift A Smile you can give products online to charity through verified NGOs. It is still “Day 1” and we will relentlessly focus on expanding selection and raising the bar for customer experience and online shopping in India.
